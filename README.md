# Cryptocurrencies

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to provide an analysis of currently traded cryptocurrencies and to cluster them for potential investment portfolios. The data used required much cleaning and preprocessing in order to utilize principal component analysis (PCA) reduced to three dimensions, which allowed for K-means clustering and three-dimensional visualization of these clusters.
